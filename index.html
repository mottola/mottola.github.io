          <p>
            I'm Rick Mottola, a software developer based out of Boise, Idaho. I
            studied Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder for a
            year, and then attended an intense, fast-paced coding bootcamp.
            While there, I honed my analytical skills and developed advanced
            knowledge in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I reinforced and applied
            those skills by building several projects which utilized various
            different web technologies (check them out below!).
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            My first professional role was at a startup where we were building a
            hybrid web application targeting individuals at risk for diabetes.
            Our platform aimed to empower these individuals to reach and
            maintain a healthy lifestyle via health education, gamified
            activities, and personlized health coaching. The tech stack
            consisted of Node.js, React, MongoDB, and Redis.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            At my next role with Mad Mobile, I collected large datasets from the
            public and private APIs of large brick and mortar stores. I would
            then transform the data to meet specific contracts that our UI
            consumed from, and assist in the building of the UI components. The
            vision at Mad Mobile was to redefine and modernize in-store shopping
            by allowing retail associates to utilize our application for a
            real-time, personalized shopping experience. The tech stack
            consisted of Node.js, React, and Redux.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            My latest role was with Two Six Labs, a research and engineering
            firm specializing in advanced analytics, cyber security, and
            tactical mobility. I was tasked with maintaining and improving
            legacy code using Groovy and JQuery, while rebuilding and
            componentizing much of the code base using React and Redux.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            Outside of work, I am always looking for ways to deepen my knowledge
            and improve my skill-set. It is very important to me that I continue
            to challenge myself while maintaining a growth mindset. I enjoy the
            challenge and dynamism of software development - there is always
            something new to learn or ways to improve upon one's current
            knowledge. I accomplish this by following tech blogs, reading
            monthly industry publications, watching/attending tech talks, and
            keeping up with the documentation of my favorite technologies, and
            of course, writing code and building things!
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            Although JavaScript was my first love and the tool which I am most
            proficient in, I still find great joy in wandering out of my comfort
            zone to meddle with other programming languages. I enjoy learning
            the different intricasies and methodologies and have found that this
            only improves the way that I reason about my code. I have worked
            with and understand all of the major paradigms (procedural,
            object-oriented, and functional), and feel comfortable working with
            any of them. I believe every software problem presents unique
            challenges, and the best tools should be chosen accordingly in
            reaching a solution.

          <p class="about">
            I value my family above all else in life. I spend as much time as
            possible with my wife and son, and seeing the sense of wonder in my
            son's eyes just puts everything into perspective. I love escaping to
            nature because it is where I can decompress and find peace. I climb
            mountains during the summer, enjoy stargazing, and love learning
            about other cultures. I love food, probably too much! I love to
            read. High fantasy is my favorite, but I also enjoy non-fiction. I
            like to relax in my hammock while listening to music or the sounds
            of nature. I hope to one day travel the world with my family.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="about">
            If I was able to change one thing in the world, it would be the
            inequality of human living standards across various regions. I was
            lucky enough to be born in the United States, but many millions of
            others did not have the fortune of being born into a safe country
            with high standards of living. Each day, millions of individuals
            find themselves struggling just to survive. Starvation, disease,
            poverty, corruption, and war plague many countries, and the
            inhabitants of these countries often have no way out. I envision a
            world where no matter where one is born, they have the fundamental
            human rights of food, water, safety, and freedom. Although it is a
            very difficult problem to solve, I believe that techonology combined
            with global effort and awareness will play a major role in bringing
            this vision into fruition.
